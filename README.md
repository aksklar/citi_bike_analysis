# Citi Bike Analysis

The premise of this project was to take New York's Citi Bike data for 2017 and illustrate the data with Tableau.  After collecting 2017's data from the Citi Bike data site, I cleaned the CSV and loaded it onto Jupyter Notebook to merge twelve CSVs into one CSV for Tableau.  Once the data was uploaded to Tableau, I create multiple visualizations to answer the following questions:<br/>

* How many trips have been recorded total during the chosen period?<br/>
* By what percentage has total ridership grown? <br/>
* How has the proportion of short-term customers and annual subscribers changed? <br/>
* Today, what are the peak hours in which bikes are used during summer months? <br/>
* Today, what are the peak hours in which bikes are used during winter months? <br/>
* Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? <br/>
* Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? <br/>
* Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? <br/>
* Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? <br/>
* Today, what is the gender breakdown of active participants (Male v. Female)? <br/>
* How effective has gender outreach been in increasing female ridership over the course of the year? <br/>
* How does the average trip duration change by age? <br/>
* What is the average distance in miles that a bike is ridden? <br/>
* Which Bikes (by ID) are most likely due for repair or inspection this year? <br/> 
* How variable is the utilization by bike ID? <br/>

In addition, I also created: <br/>

* A static map that plots all bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to start and end a journey with zip code data overlaid on top. <br/>
* A dynamic map that shows how each station's popularity changes over time (by month and year). <br/>
